            <h3>What exactly is a Vertex AI TI-84?</h3>
            <p>
              It's a genuine Texas Instruments TI-84 graphing calculator that has been modified
              by our engineering team to include a custom AI module. The module connects to
              ChatGPT and is accessible through the calculator's existing controls. It looks
              and works like a normal TI-84 — with an added layer of intelligence.
            </p>

          <article class="panel">
            <h3>Does the AI work without internet?</h3>
            <p>
              The AI module requires a connection to process queries. However, all standard
              TI-84 functions work normally offline. The calculator never loses its original
              capabilities — the AI is an addition, not a replacement.

            <h3>Will this void my TI-84 warranty?</h3>
            <p>
              Opening and modifying the hardware does void the manufacturer's warranty. However,
              Vertex Instruments provides its own support and quality guarantee on every unit
              we build, covering the modification and the original hardware.

            <h3>What's the difference between Core and Pro+?</h3>
            <p>
              The Core model covers everyday math (algebra, stats, trig) with standard response
              speed and 30-day support. The Pro+ has a faster response module, expanded prompt
              presets (calculus, engineering), step-by-step explanations, and 90-day priority
              support. <a class="text-link" href="calculators.html">See the full comparison →</a>

            <h3>How long does shipping take?</h3>
            <p>
              Standard orders ship within 5–10 business days. Each unit is built to order, so
              delivery depends on current demand. Rush build slots may be available for an
              additional fee — ask when you submit your request.

            <p>
              Yes. Mail-in modifications are available for most TI-84 models. Contact us with
              your model details and we'll provide a custom quote, turnaround estimate, and
              shipping instructions for getting your calculator to us.

            <p>
              Absolutely. Bundle discounts apply when you purchase an AI TI-84 model and at
              least one program pack. Save $15 on one pack, $35 on two, or $50 on all three.
              Discounts are applied automatically.

              every unit we ship and thoroughly test each one before it leaves our bench. If
              your calculator arrives with a defect, contact us and we'll work with you to
              resolve the issue as quickly as possible.

            <h3>Are these allowed in exams?</h3>
            <p>
              Policies vary by school and testing authority. The physical calculator is still a
              standard TI-84, which is allowed in most exam settings. However, AI features may
              not be permitted during proctored tests. Always confirm your institution's rules
              before using AI features in assessments.

          <article class="panel">
            <h3>How do I access the AI on the calculator?</h3>
            <p>
              The AI interface is mapped to specific key combinations on your TI-84. Your
              quick-start card explains exactly how to launch it, enter prompts, and navigate
              responses. Most users are comfortable within 5 minutes.

          <article class="panel">
            <h3>Does the AI drain the battery faster?</h3>
            <p>
              We optimize firmware to minimize battery impact. During normal mixed use (regular
              calculations + occasional AI queries), battery life is comparable to a standard
              TI-84. Heavy AI usage will drain the battery faster, similar to any connected device.
            </p>
          </article>
          <article class="panel">
            <h3>Can I use the program packs without the AI upgrade?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes! Program packs work on any TI-84 calculator, modified or not. They're
              standard TI-BASIC and Assembly programs that run natively on the device.

              Yes. Orders of 5+ units qualify for volume pricing. Larger deployments (10–200+)
              come with additional benefits including dedicated support, custom prompt libraries,

              order within 60 days, we'll credit the evaluation unit toward your total purchase.
