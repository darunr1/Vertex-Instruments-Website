            Vertex Instruments exists to bridge the gap between trusted classroom hardware and
            modern AI capabilities. We believe students and professionals shouldn't have to choose
            between the calculator they already know and the intelligence they need.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every unit we ship starts as a standard TI-84 and is carefully transformed through
            precision electrical engineering, custom module design, and rigorous quality testing.
            The result is a device that feels familiar but works smarter.

          <h2>From a dorm-room idea to a real product line</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            Vertex Instruments started when our founder, a college engineering student, got tired of
            switching between a $150 graphing calculator and a smartphone just to check a concept
            mid-exam-prep. The question was simple: <strong>what if the calculator itself could explain
              things?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            What began as a weekend soldering project quickly turned into something bigger. After
            months of prototyping, firmware experiments, and late-night troubleshooting, the first
            Vertex AI TI-84 was born - a fully functional calculator with a discreet, integrated AI
            module wired directly into the mainboard.
          </p>
          <p>
            Word spread fast. Classmates wanted one. Then tutoring centers asked about bulk orders.
            Today, Vertex Instruments is building toward serving individual students, tutors, and
            educational institutions - all from the same hands-on, engineering-driven process that
            built the very first unit.

              Every solder joint, every firmware flash, every calibration step is performed by hand
              with surgical attention to detail. We don't cut corners because students depend on
              the result.

            <p>
              A calculator that fails during a test is worse than no calculator at all. Every unit
              undergoes stress testing, thermal checks, and multi-day burn-in cycles before it
              leaves our bench.

            <p>
              AI shouldn't require a learning curve. Our interface is mapped to familiar TI-84
              controls so users can start getting answers in seconds - no app downloads, no accounts,
              no friction.

              We're constantly refining our hardware integration process, exploring faster response
              modules, and expanding the prompt libraries our calculators ship with. Standing still

          <h2>Our Engineering Philosophy</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="two-col-content">
          <div class="panel">
            <h3>Hardware-first design</h3>
            <p>
              We don't slap software onto generic hardware. Every Vertex calculator starts with a
              full teardown and inspection of the donor TI-84. We assess board health, trace
              integrity, and component condition before any modifications begin.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our custom AI module is designed in-house to fit within the existing enclosure without
              modifying the external shell. This means your calculator still looks and feels exactly
              like a standard TI-84 - the intelligence is entirely internal.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="panel">
            <h3>Quality at every stage</h3>
            <p>
              Integration happens in four controlled stages: board prep, component placement,
              solder-level connection, and firmware configuration. Each stage has its own pass/fail
              checkpoints.
            </p>
            <p>
              After assembly, every unit goes through a 48-hour burn-in test where it runs
              continuous AI queries, graphing operations, and battery-drain simulations. Only units
              that pass every check ship to customers.
